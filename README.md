In this project I created a mockup company providing booth a delivery and a payment service. It was thought to be used as a compliment for services as Tradera or Blocket where	individuals trade goods with each other. When dealing with booth the delivery and the payment there would be total safety that no one got a product that they haven't paid for and no one shipped something that they wouldn't be paid for.

This was a project was part of a course in database technology, and the reason behind it was to let the students build a simple but functional system combining previous programming skills and newley learned skills of database structures. My program is written in python and implements a simple GUI where it is possible to create a new user, either as buyer, seller or driver. Each user type got their own login from where they can manage their accounts and participate in trades.
